	<strong>Measurement Spatial Resolution, IFOVmeas</strong>
</p>
<p>The smallest target spot size on which an infrared imager can produce
	a measurement, expressed in terms of angular subtense (mrad per side).
	The slit response function (SRF) test is used to measure IFOVmeas.</p>

	<strong>Micro-Cooler </strong>
</p>
<p>A small, palm size cooler based on the Stirling cycle that cools an
	infrared detector or focal plane array to liquid nitrogen temperature
	(77K).</p>
<p class="B_text_B">
	<strong>Micron [Micrometer] [m or, mm ] </strong>
</p>
<p>One millionth of a meter; a unit used to express wavelength in the
	infrared.
<p class="B_text_B">
	<strong>Noise Equivalent Temperature [Difference], NET[D] </strong>
</p>
<p>The temperature difference that is just equal to the rms noise
	signal; a measure of thermal resolution; (thermal sensitivity), but not
	taking into account target size, characteristics of the display and the
	subjective interpretation of the operator.</p>

	<strong>Objective, Objective Lens</strong>

</p>
<p>The primary lens of an optical system, on an infrared instrument,
	usually the interchangeable lens that defines the total field of view.
</p>

<p class="B_text_B">
	<strong>Opaque</strong>
</p>
<p>In thermography, an opaque material is one that does not transmit
	thermal infrared energy, ( t = 0).</p>

<p class="B_text_B">
	<strong>Pixel</strong>
</p>
<p>Abbreviation for picture element. In infrared technology a pixel is a
	focal plane array element, for scanning systems is defined by the IFOV,
	for spot radiometers by FOV.</p>

<p class="B_text_B">
	<strong>Planck, Max Karl Ernst Ludwig</strong>
</p>
<p>German physicist who incorporated quantum physics into the blackbody
	spectral radiance equation, giving rise to blackbody curves.</p>

<p class="B_text_B">
	<strong>Radian</strong>

</p>
<p>An angular measurement equal to the ratio of the arc length of a
	circle to its radius. The circumference of a circle is 2p times the
	radius. Thus p radians = 180 degrees, and 1 radian = 57.29578 degrees.</p>

<p class="B_text_B">
	<strong>Radiation, Thermal </strong>

</p>
<p>The mode of heat flow that occurs by emission and absorption of
	electromagnetic radiation, propagating at the speed of light. Unlike
	conductive and convective heat flow, it is capable of propagating
	across a vacuum.</p>
