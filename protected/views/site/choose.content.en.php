	<p>Doubtless, the complexity of specifications can be an obstacle to
		understanding IR systems. However this should not be a reason for
		making a wrong choice. Any time spent in researching and consulting
		with existing users will be well spent. IR cameras are very clever
		devices, have great potential to pay for themselves many times over
		when applied to condition monitoring of expensive plant, and are
		becoming easier to use and afford. over recent years they have earned
		a place in the NDT "toolbox" along with the more established methods.
