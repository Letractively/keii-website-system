	<strong>Thermal Imaging Terms and Definitions </strong>
</p>

<p class="B_text_B">
	<strong>Absolute zero</strong>
</p>
<p>The temperature that is zero on the Kelvin or Rankine temperature
	scales. The temperature at which a material is at its lowest energy
	state.</p>

<p class="B_text_B">
	<strong>Absorptivity, a [Absorptance]</strong>
</p>
<p>The proportion (as a fraction of 1) of the radiant energy impinging
	on a material’s surface that is absorbed into the material. For a
	blackbody, this is unity (1.0). Technically, absorptivity is the
	internal absorptance per unit path length. In thermography, the two
	terms are often used interchangeably.</p>

<p class="B_text_B">
	<strong>Accuracy [of Measurement]</strong>
</p>
<p>The maximum deviation, expressed in % of scale or in degrees Celsius
	or degrees Fahrenheit, that the reading of an instrument will deviate
	from an acceptable standard reference.</p>

<p class="B_text_B">
	<strong> Ambient Operating Range </strong>
</p>
<p>Range of ambient temperatures over which an instrument is designed to
	operate within published performance specifications.</p>

<p class="B_text_B">
	<strong> Ambient Temperature</strong>
</p>
<p>Temperature of the air in the vicinity of the target (target ambient)
	or the instrument (instrument ambient).</p>


<p class="B_text_B">
	<strong> Atmospheric Windows [Infrared] </strong>
</p>
<p>The spectral intervals within the infrared spectrum in which the
	atmosphere transmits radiant energy well (atmospheric absorption is a
	minimum.). These are roughly defined as 3-5 μm and 8-14 μm.</p>



<p class="B_text_B">
	<strong> Blackbody, Blackbody Radiator </strong>
</p>
<p>A perfect radiator, one that radiates the maximum number of photons
	in a unit time from a unit area in a specified spectral interval into a
	hemisphere that any body in thermodynamic equilibrium at the same
	temperature can radiate. It follows that a blackbody absorbs all
	radiant energy impinging on it and reflects and transmits none; thus a
	surface with emissivity of unity (1.0).</p>

<p class="B_text_B">
	<strong>Calibration</strong>
</p>
<p>Checking and/or adjusting an instrument such that its readings agree
	with a standard. Calibration removes instrument systematic error and
	quantifies the instrument random error.</p>

<p class="B_text_B">
	<strong> Calibration Accuracy</strong>
</p>
<p>The accuracy, to which a calibration is performed, usually based on
	the accuracy and sensitivity of the instruments and references used in
	the calibration.</p>


<p class="B_text_B">
	<strong>Capacitance, Thermal</strong>
</p>
<p>This term is used to describe heat capacity in terms of an electrical
	analog, where loss of heat in analogous to loss of charge on a
	capacitor. Structures with high thermal capacitance lose heat more
	slowly than those structures with low thermal capacitance.</p>

<p class="B_text_B">
	<strong>Capacity, Heat</strong>
</p>
<p>The heat capacity of a material or structure describes its ability to
	store heat. It is the product of the specific heat (c---p) and the
	density (r) of the material. This means that denser materials generally
	will have higher heat capacities than porous materials.</p>
