			<td>The Infrared thermal imaging system can be used in all phases
				from smelting to rolling, such as temperature measurement of
				continuous casting slab, temperature measurement of steel model,
				temperature measurement and control of ex-furnace slab, temperature
				measurement of hot roller surface, temperature measurement of steel
				ingot etc. Meanwhile, it can also detect and gather information
				about fireproof and insulation materials, the furnaceâ€™s corrosion,
				crack, thinning, block and leakage etc. It is very important to
				prevent accident and reduce energy consumption.</td>
